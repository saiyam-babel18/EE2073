    "like this? Which parameter should be changed? What effect do you think this will have on the final\n",
    "image?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Answer: \n",
    "- You can generate pulses which look similar to the ones given in the plot by using the `wrsc(t)` function defined above, which is basically the `sinc` function.\n",
    "- Make the value of `C` = 2.\n",
    "- SincP is the parameter you need to change to get different types of pulse shape.\n",
    "- To get the first figure, you need to change the SincP parameter to `1.0`. SincP is the dilation factor of the sinc function, which means that it decides how strechted or how compressed the sinc function would look like. \n",
    "- For figure 1, we needed a less compressed version of sinc, hence we reduced the SincP factor to 1.0\n",
    "- For figure 2, we need a much more compressed version of sinc, hence we increase the SincP parameter to `5.0`\n",
    "- You can also alter `Nsamp` and `dist_per_samp` values to alter the graph but the main parameter which determines the shape of the graph is `SincP`."

    "#### QUESTIONS : \n",
    "1) Does it make sense to reconstruct up to `Nsamp`? What value is more reasonable as an upper limit for the x-axis here?\n",
    "\n",
    "    `Answer`: No, the more reasonable upper limit for x axis here is `(Nsamp*dist_per_samp)/C`. This value is the upper limit of the time sample. This is more reasonable because we have contructed the source function using `time samples` as x-axis parameter, so it better to use that instead of just `Nsamp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The (x, y) coordinates corresponding to the maximum amplitude (yellow colour) is approximately (30, 22). Explain why this is the correct expected position for the given obstacle\n",
    "\n",
    "    `Answer`: This is the correct expected position. The X coordinate in the HEATMAP corresponds to the no. of `time` samples. Here there are total of 100 time samples with upper limit (`(Nsamp*dist_per_samp)/C`) as 10, so the x coordinate of the obstacle (3) will now correspond to 30. For the y-coordinate, we contructed the grid such that y-axis is (0,63) for the 64 Mics. Earlier it was -3.2 to +3.2 (mic position) but after scaling and shifting, we can see that the y-coordinate of the obstacle (-1) should corresponding to approximately 22 [`-1*10(scale) +32(shift)`]\n",
    "    \n",
    "3) What is the maximum obstacle x- and y- coordinate that you can use and still have an image reconstructed?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    `Answer`: You can take the x- coordinate upto the the max limit of `(Nsamp*dist_per_samp)/C`. As for the y- coordinate, as long as you are in the range of Nmics, you will get a decent reconstructed image.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4) What happens if C is different - if C is decreased it looks like the image becomes sharper. Can you explain why intuitively?\n",
    "\n",
    "    `Answer`: If C is reduced, the sharpness increases because `(Nsamp*dist_per_samp)/C` increases and hence the number of time samples increase giving a more sharper image.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5) What happens if Nmics is increased or decreased? Do the experiments with Nmics = [8, 32, 64] and Nsamp = [50, 100, 200] (all combinations). Attach the resulting images.\n",
